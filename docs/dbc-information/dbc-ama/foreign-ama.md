Q：First of all thank you for accepting our invitation and welcome to our community, can you please introduce yourself and your project?

A： I am Feng He , the founder of DeepBrain Chain. I graduated from Ocean University of China in 2008 with a bachelor degree in Computer Science, briefly worked at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and then went to East China Normal University for a master’s degree in Bioinformatics (I dropped out of school in 2010 to start my own business).

I have always been fascinated by AI technology, and when I was a graduate student, I also used AI technology to do genetic data analysis, so I can say that I have been developing AI technology application early. Later, I started my own business to try to implement AI technology into real products. From 2011, we started our business in the field of artificial intelligence, and have taken $8 million investment from Qihoo 360, Gobi, JD, GSR and other investment institutions. At the end of 2011 we released China’s first smart voice assistant — Smart 360, in 2014 we released the world’s first voice interaction AI speaker — Xiaozhi Super Speaker (six months earlier than Amazon Echo, 3 years earlier than DuerOS speaker), in 2017 I founded DeepBrain Chain, and has been working on it til today.

DeepBrain Chain was founded in 2017 with the vision of building an infinitely scalable distributed high-performance computing network based on blockchain technology, in order to become the most important computing infrastructure in the era of AI+metaverse. DeepBrain Chain contains three important parts: high-performance computing network, blockchain mainnet and GPU computing mainnet. High-performance computing network officially launched at the end of 2018, blockchain mainnet on May 20th, 2021, after nearly 4 months of public testing, GPU computing mainnet have officially launched last month.

The mainnet of DeepBrain Chain is developed based on PolkaSubstrate, and DeepBrain Chain is also one of the very few high-performance computing projects in the blockchain industry that have achieved large-scale implementation. It has been widely used in various scenarios such as artificial intelligence, driverless vehicles, cloud games, visual rendering, biopharmaceuticals, etc. It has provided high-performance GPU computing power for many enterprises, and cumulatively more than 50 vendors worldwide have deployed high-performance GPU cloud platforms based on DeepBrain Chain network, serving hundreds of enterprises and tens of thousands of AI developer groups. For example, China’s cloud game vendor NetEase Cloud Game uses GPU resources from DeepBrain Chain, China’s leading driverless company AutoX is testing GPU resources from DeepBrain Chain, China’s leading cloud game solution provider TingYu Technology is cooperating with us, Beijing University, Tsinghua University and Harvard University have students and teachers using DeepBrain Chain’s GPUs for AI training.

Q：I am sure most of our community members don’t know what high performance computing is, can you please tell us more about this and how DeepBrain Chain can integrate this to blockchain?

A：DeepBrain Chain network of high-performance computing power is currently mainly only using GPU as the core of high-performance computing resources, in the future we may include NPU/TPU, or even quantum computing; but the current view is that it will be dominated by GPU for quite a long time, the current market value of high-end GPU chip manufacturers Nvidia has nearly three times the market value of CPU chip manufacturers Intel, the reason is that with the development of various emerging industries such as 5G, artificial intelligence, life sciences, autonomous driving, meta-universe, these industries need very powerful computing power, currently GPU is the best choice, but GPU computing power resources are very expensive.

Based on blockchain technology, DeepBrain Chain (DBC) created an infinitely scalable distributed high-performance computing network, the world’s idle GPU resources can independently join the DBC network, customers worldwide can also rent the GPU computing resources of the DBC network, and every transaction data is available on the chain, to promote the popularization and civilianization of AI computing resources, while promoting the blockchain technology on the ground to serve more real industries, it’s not just transactions of monetary value, after more than four years of research and development and commercial operation, this path has proved to be totally feasible.

Q：Which public chain ecology is DeepBrain Chain mainly based on? We know that the mainnet of DeepBrain Chain is now online. What are the differences?

A： DeepBrain Chain mainnet is developed based on PocaSubstrate, and DeepBrain Chain itself is an application chain focused on artificial computing, focusing on application as well as commercialization.

Q： China is a leading country in AI technology and AI will play a very important part in our life in near future. Can you please tell us more about what AI can change in our daily life, what kind of benefits it will give to us? As you can imagine, everyone knows what AI is, but don’t have any understanding about it.

A：We often use Tiktok, on the app there will be a variety of special effects, these effects use computing and GPU computing resources; the current hot topic ‘’meta-universe’’, if you want to achieve that you need to use the cloud VR and AR rendering to achieve a realistic simulation of the real world, and these need powerful GPU distributed around the world to support the computing needs; we look at Hollywood blockbusters, they also need powerful computing power; and the future L4 level of fully autonomous driving also needs huge computing power.

Q：Now the hot spots in the market may be more on NFT, Metaverse and Gamefi. Will DeepBrain Chain develop business in these areas afterwards?

A：You may not be aware that the distributed high-performance computing network built by DeepBrain Chain is one of the key supporting technologies of the meta-universe. Among the six supporting technologies of metaverse (blockchain technology, Internet of Things technology, interaction technology, video game technology, artificial intelligence technology, network and computing technology), four of them are closely related to DeepBrain Chain, and the cloud game, which is the key service area of DeepBrain Chain, is the necessary path to the metaverse era. The distributed high-performance computing with GPU as the core is becoming an indispensable part of the closed loop of the future meta-universe ecosystem, and DeepBrain Chain has been working in this field for nearly four years and has become the undisputed leader in this space.

Q：What is the difference between DeepBrain Chain and traditional cloud computing companies?

A：DeepBrain Chain uses blockchain technology to build a new production relationship and innovatively solve the problem of computing power supply; by reconstructing the cloud computing industry chain, it turns a closed system dominated by giants like cloud computing into an open system where everyone can participate in common construction and share benefits, and jointly build the infrastructure in the era of 5G+AI.

Advantages of DBC: Due to the development of 5G+AI technology and the rise of edge computing, the demand for edge-side computing (high performance, high density, low latency, low cost and full coverage) is getting stronger and stronger, and the traditional mega data centers can no longer meet the demand of business development, and it is necessary to schedule and manage data centers of different levels (cloud nodes, metropolitan nodes and edge nodes), so it is urgent that we create an unified distributed computing network to better meet the business demand and at the same time improve the efficiency of computing resources utilization, which is where the advantages of blockchain technology lie.

Q： After so many years of technology accumulation, what unique advantages does DeepBrain Chain have?

A：The uniqueness of DeepBrain Chain lies in its being an artificial intelligence public chain, because all the technology research and development is for this positioning, and the main technical innovations are as follows:

Q：Lately we’ve seen many projects adopt buyback-and-burn programs to support long term price stability and value growth. What do you think about it? Have you thought about incorporating this program? Or will your project use other strategies to ensure price stability？

A： When the dbc network has more than 5,000 GPUs, the monthly dbc of 800,000 US dollars will be destroyed, if any, the monthly dbc of 8 million US dollars will be destroyed. And the more machines there are, the more dbc pledged. A gpu needs to pledge 100,000 dbc.

Q：Staking is the new trend. What staking options are available for $DBC token? Are there any incentives for staking? What are the various ways to earn $DBC token and are there any limits to amount of $DBC I can earn?

A： https://www.dbcwallet.io/#/staking

Q：Many new projects initially developed well but were suddenly abandoned. How will DeepBrain manage the project to maintain its position in the market and become a good project in the blockchain world?

A：Dbc has been in development for 4 years and has experienced a complete bull-bear cycle in the blockchain industry. 95% of the projects we created at the same time 4 years ago are dead, but we are still alive and well. We have not only realized the technology mentioned in the white paper, but also dbc has truly served users and produced actual value. The dbc network now has 1,000 GPUs. These GPU servers are worth more than 7 million U.S. dollars. They generate rent every month. When the number of GPUs exceeds 5000, a large amount of dbc will be destroyed every month.

Q：How important is the community to Your project? and How can we collaborate or help share token for the development of the project?

A：The dbc has a council system. The board has the right to use 50 million dbc every year. For a total of 15 years, any community member can become a member of the board by voting, and any community member of the board can apply for the development of the dbc ecology.

Q：What is the creation story of the DeepBrain Chain project?
A：We have been focusing on AI projects since 2011, including voice assistants, smart speakers, and other products. We realized the importance of GPU early, but GPU resources are very expensive and many startups can't afford it. Blockchain technology can help achieve this goal.

Q：What advantages does DBC have over potential competitors?
A：We believe that the team's knowledge of what they are doing makes or breaks things to a large extent. With almost 10 years of AI experience, we naturally have a deep understanding of AI computing, as well as over five years of experience with blockchain technology; it's impossible to do this with just an understanding of blockchain or just an understanding of AI. In four years, we have accomplished all the development goals on the whitepaper and commercialised multiple scenarios in meta-boundary, autonomous driving, AI, visual rendering, blockchain and more.

Q：How can one acquire the DBC token and what are the utilities?
A：You can buy DBC on Huobi or Gate exchange. DBC is the only payment credential in the entire DBC arithmetic network, and enterprises need to use DBC to provide arithmetic to the DBC network or rent arithmetic, including pledging.

Q：Can you tell us more about the Galaxy Computing Power Competition that DeepBrainChain is conducting? What is the competition intended for? Can we participate in the competition too?
A：For all information about the Galaxy Race, you can check the official website: https://galaxyrace.deepbrainchain.org/
About the contest rules, arithmetic map、 arithmetic details 、 AI server rental, and pledge are explained, everyone is welcome to actively participate. The purpose of Galaxy Race is to let more computing power providers join the DeepBrain Chain network, and at present, the arithmetic is in serious supply, all people are free to join the DeepBrain Chain network as long as the server configuration and storage environment meets the requirements.

Q ：I read that being a supernode in DBC can have its own benefits. But can you tell us the requirements to be a supernode? How often is the election done? Who all can vote? How are the rewards distributed?
A:There are currently 100 million DBC per year awarded to supernodes, and there are currently 31 nodes in total. To become a supernode, you need to hold a certain number of DBC and the support of community coin holders, and you need to be able to rank in the top 31 to have a chance to be selected, and you need to have a server that can take care of the blocks. Currently, the election is held every 24 hours, and all coin holders have the opportunity to participate in the voting. The reward will be distributed proportionally according to the rules set by the nodes. You can check the official Twitter announcement and the DBC main network for details. https://www.dbcwallet.io

Q：An interesting feature that caught my attention was your integral cross-chain mining, so could you explain to me what this mining consists of and how beneficial it will be for the users to be able to participate in your mining
A：The "mining" in DBC is essentially an online reward, where the computing power provider only needs to provide GPU resources to get the reward; these computing power will be used to be rented by customers in AI, cloud gaming, metaverse, visual rendering, autonomous driving, blockchain, and other related fields, and the computing power providers can get both online reward and computing power rental revenue.

Q：In DeepBrainchain, you have combined two world best technologies, high performance compute network and blockchain technology. My question is what are the advantages and benefits that community can enjoy from deepbrainchain?
A：DeepBrain Chain’s vision is to build an infinitely scalable high-performance distributed computing power network, and become the most important computing infrastructure in the AI+MetaVerse era.At present, DeepBrain Chain is in a leading position in this field. The high-performance computing market is a huge market worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and it may reach trillions of dollars in the future. The goal of DeepBrain Chain is to get a share of this field and the community can also benefit from it.

Q：Please share complete tokenomics of $DBC token with its distribution and vesting period? Also tell us use cases of token in whole ecosystem of deepbrainChain?
A：DBC has 10 billion DBC tokens in total, 40% of which will be distributed as online rewards to the computing power providers, 10% will be rewarded to the early computing power providers that provided computing power on DBC network before the mainnet went online, that is to say, 50% of the tokens are allocated to computing power providers. The team has 1 billion DBCs, which will be unlocked in ten years on average, and the Foundation and Council has a total of 2.5 billion, which will be unlocked in nineteen years, so the reason for doing this is to have enough patience for DBC. At present the total circulation of DBC is more than 4 billion.
DBC computing power provider's rewards consist of two parts: supernodes block producing rewards and computing power provider online rewards, the first three years are 100 million and 400 million DBC respectively, from the third year on the amount is halved, after that the amount is halved again every five years.
Supernode pledge: currently there are 31 supernodes, tentatively 10 nodes will be added each quarter.
Each node first need to pledges DBC tokens to participate in the supernode election;
Any DBC holder can pledge DBC to vote for the node, and rewards are also given to voters;
The top 31 nodes voters can become supernodes, the election is held every 24 hours.
GPU power provider pledge rules:
From 0 to 10,000 GPUs, 100,000 DBCs are pledged per GPU.
Starting from 10,001 GPU, the formula for the total number of DBC that needs to be pledged is:
1 billion + 100,000 x (10000/10001 + 10000/10002 + ∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙ + 10000/(10000+n)).
If the above formula is accounted for and a single GPU is pledged at 1,500 USD 50,000 RMB, then the pledge is calculated at 1500 USD 50,000 RMB.

Example of the number of single GPU pledges:

Assuming that n0000 shows the first 1000 GPUs after 10,000, then the number of pledges for the 11000th GPU is: 100,000 x 10000/11000.

DBCs pledged by each graphics card need to be pledged for at least 365 days; when the machine is online for more than 365 days and no user uses it for more than 10 days, you can exit the pledged, take the machine offline and release the pledged DBC within 3 days, and the previously obtained rewards will continue to be released linearly.

There is also the deflationary model, which is the DBC burning rule.

When the DBC network reaches 5,000 GPUs across the network, 100% of the rents paid by users after activation are destroyed, which means DBC will enter a deflationary state. So reaching 5,000 GPUs in the DBC network will be an important milestone!

DBC is the only payment credentials in the entire DBC arithmetic network, and enterprises need to use DBC to provide arithmetic to the DBC network or rent arithmetic, including pledging.

Q：What are your aims in next 2 years according to your roadmap? What if I ask you what is the ultimate goal of DeepBrainchain?

A：On the supply side, the goal of DeepBrain Chain ecosystem in the next 2 years is to add 100 computing pools worldwide to join the DBC network, providing a continuous source of computing power for the computing network; at the same time, on the demand side, the goal of DeepBrain Chain ecosystem in the next 2 years is to add 50-100 AI cloud platforms globally, the value of these cloud platforms is so that the network can sell the computing power to them, and the income is used for the destruction of DBC, thus forming a closed business loop.

DeepBrain Chain’s vision is to build an infinitely scalable high-performance distributed computing power network, and become the most important computing infrastructure in the AI+MetaVerse era.

Q：What is the overall design of DBC’s community governance mechanism? What is the process of initiation if new institutions are to be added in the future (such as the Council to be established in the near future)?

A：DeepBrain Chain community autonomy mainly relies on DeepBrain Chain Council, DeepBrain Chain Council has 51 million DBC per year for 15 years; all Council members are elected by the community and are responsible for managing the distribution of Council funds, all community members can propose to apply for funds and contribute to the ecosystem, Foundation members do not participate in the election and operation of the Council. At present, DeepBrain Chain Council is in the trial run stage, and will run officially from January next year.

Q：Currently, projects are continuously attacked by hackers. That is the nightmare of many projects. So, what is your strategy to anticipate hacking possibilities on your platform? What plan do you have in order not to let #DeepBrainChain get hacked and cost investors?

A：This is a very good question, we mainly deal with hacker attacks from two aspects: 1. DeepBrain Chain will conduct strict code audit every time it is upgraded, and find professional organizations in the industry to do security audit, and at the same time, it will run for a trial period before upgrading 2. DeepBrain Chain itself is a high performance computing network, the network has thousands of nodes, each node is a high performance server, currently there are 31 supernodes responsible for the producing blocks, and at the same time, 10 nodes will be added every quarter, so it is very difficult and incredibly costly to attack DeepBrain Chain network.

Q：Do you think you can connect real-life and CryptoWorld with you project?How do you think the utility of you projects?

A：Yes, the vision of DeepBrain Chain is to build an infinitely scalable distributed high-performance computing network and become the most important computing infrastructure in the era of AI+meta-universe. It was positioned as an application public chain at the beginning, hoping to serve real industries, and has successfully realized the industrial implementation in the past four years, and has served more than 100 enterprises and nearly 20,000 AI developers in many scenarios including AI, autonomous driving, meta-universe, visual rendering, etc.From this connection：https://galaxyrace.deepbrainchain.org, you can query the GPU rental status on the chain. It can be seen that the rental rate is very high. The GPUs on the DeepBrain Chain platform are very popular.

For example, the NetEase cloud gaming platform is using the GPU of the DBC platform

Q：What is your inspiration behind this project and how are u planning to expand your ecosystem and attracting more investors so that you can stay in the business for a long time?

A：We have been focusing on AI projects since 2011, including voice assistants, smart speakers and other products. We realized the importance of GPU early, but GPU resources are very expensive and many startups can't afford it. Blockchain technology can help achieve this goal.The gpu market is very large. The gpu cloud service market can reach 10 million cards in the next 5 years. We aim to have a global market share of 20% in the next 5 years. The annual rent from the DBC platform can exceed 4 billion U.S. dollars. And these equivalent DBCs will be destroyed

Q：DeepBrainChain is deployed and issued as a substrate of Polkadot network. Can you explain to us why did your team decide to be that way? Was it convenient to implement your products and services as a substrate of Polkadot?

A：As mentioned above, the mainnet is only a part of DeepBrain Chain's products. The high-performance computing network, and GPU computing mainnet are equally important. We chose to develop based on substrate because of its cross-chain technology, community governance mechanism and Polkadot ecology. So far, our choice is correct and everything is working well.

Q：What metaverse will your project develop? Will it be developed by your team or will DBC just serve as a network provider for other projects to be built on top of it?

A：The advent of the meta-universe era must rely on a powerful distributed high-performance computing power network. This is where the value of DeepBrain Chain lies.

DeepBrain Chain’s vision is to build an infinitely scalable high-performance distributed computing power network, and become the most important computing infrastructure in the AI+MetaVerse era. We will not develop meta-universe projects by ourselves.

Q：The NFT Medal is the highest award of the DBC community. can the NFT medal be obtained by all users or can it be obtained by the general public too? how do we get the NFT medal? are there any special requirements to get the NFT medal? And can the NFT medal be sold in the future?

A：The NFT medal is a free gift to community members who have contributed to the DBC ecology. It is divided into gold, silver, and bronze. Community members can apply to the board of directors, and they will be issued after the board of directors votes. NFT medals can also be traded on the NFT market. The foundation will repurchase once a year. The repurchase price is as follows: NFT gold medals are equivalent to 1 million DBC, silver medals 100,000 DBC, and bronze medals 10,000 DBC.

Q：As we know, partners are one of the key success for the suistanability of a project. Which partners that DBC already had ? Which new partners that will announced soon ? Can we get a little sneak peek information about this ?

A：It has provided high-performance GPU computing power for many enterprises, and cumulatively more than 50 vendors worldwide have deployed high-performance GPU cloud platforms based on DeepBrain Chain network, serving hundreds of enterprises and tens of thousands of AI developer groups. For example, China’s cloud game vendor NetEase Cloud Game uses GPU resources from DeepBrain Chain, China’s leading driverless company AutoX is testing GPU resources from DeepBrain Chain, China’s leading cloud game solution provider TingYu Technology is cooperating with us, Beijing University, Tsinghua University and Harvard University have students and teachers using DeepBrain Chain’s GPUs for AI training.

Q：What are DeepBrainChain Marketing Department objectives?

A：This is a very good question.DeepBrain Chain’s vision is to build an infinitely scalable high-performance distributed computing power network, and become the most important computing infrastructure in the AI+MetaVerse era.At present, DeepBrain Chain is in a leading position in this field. What we have to do is to continuously expand the network GPU scale , And ensure that the GPUs in the network are leased out, and all the income obtained will be used for the repurchase and destruction of DBC (above 5000 cards). All our marketing is to serve this goal.

Q：Deep Brain Chain is a AI computing platform powered by blockchain. But most of the users doesn’t understand this. So do you have a tutorial or article on how DBC works? Why do you think AI computing is necessary in blockchain? and can you share key performance indicators of the chain, such as Number of blocks per second, transaction completion time, transaction speed, cost per transaction or something else?

A：Humanity is moving into the age of intelligence, and artificial intelligence has been integrated into every aspect of people’s lives. The Artificial intelligence troika: deep models, big data (Internet, sensors, IOT), and high-performance computing (GPU, FPGA, special chips). Individual deep models have an increasing demand for computing power: ImageNet image recognition — 1~10 GPUs, AlphaFold/AlphaFold2 — 100~200 GPUs, BERT language model — 100~200 GPUs, using 1026 TPUs, training time can be shortened to 76min, GPT- 3 language model — 1,000 GPUs OpenAI, 175 billion parameters, training once consumes millions of dollars, multimodal large-scale pre-training model — 2,000 GPUs Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI). The Artificial intelligence race is the computing power race: solving the problem of computing power supply and demand and rewarding computing power is imminent. DeepBrain Chain hopes to build an infinitely scalable, distributed high-performance computing network through blockchain technology to achieve cost reduction and efficiency improvement of AI computing power worldwide, promote the popularization and democratization of AI computing power, and accelerate the arrival of the era of AI+ metaverse.

DeepBrain Chain contains three important parts: high-performance computing network, blockchain mainnet and GPU computing mainnet. The high-performance computing network was officially launched at the end of 2018, blockchain mainnet was launched on May 20th, 2021, and GPU computing mainnet was launched on November 22nd.

The blockchain mainnet of DeepBrain Chain is developed based on PolkaSubstrate. Except for one block in 30 seconds, everything else changes dynamically; if the network is not congested, it will be packaged in 30 seconds, and 2 blocks will be the most confirmed after packing; the transfer transaction fee, a transfer is currently about 0.00015 DBC.

From the perspective of DBC’s actual business operation, the current performance indicators of the main chain are fully sufficient to support the development of DBC business for a long time in the future.

Q：DeepBrainChain is a computing project that is applicable in multiple scenarios but it captured my attention that it has been adopted by biopharmaceuticals, could you tell us how this technology is useful in healthcare systems? Do you have any examples?

A：Take the research and development of new drugs as an example. At present, it takes about 12 to 15 years to invent a new drug, which requires a cost of 1 to 2 billion U.S. dollars. The cycle is very long and the cost is very high. The emergence of AI has played a very important role, and it can shorten this cycle a lot.

There are several major trends in this. Now the entire biological world is digitizing. I have always said that the physical world is digitizing, and the biological world is also digitizing. Proteins, genes, and cells can be expressed in digital ways. The benefits of digitization are With a large amount of data, coupled with strong computing power and algorithms, the technology in artificial intelligence can be used for so many years. At present, many pharmaceuticals are looking for precise targets in small molecules. Now we use them for large molecules, antibodies, and TCR personalized vaccines and drugs, as well as the recent progress of AlphaFold in protein analysis.

These are based on massive GPU computing resources, and we are currently actively expanding our customers in this area.

Q：Southeast Asia is a very vibrant market and many project developed here. so what do you think about Southeast Asia and do you have any plan to develop here?

A：DBC registered in Singapore, so we started from Southeast Asia.
DeepBrain Chain’s vision is to build an infinitely scalable high-performance distributed computing power network, and become the most important computing infrastructure in the AI+MetaVerse era.In the next few years,we will add more add more computing pools and more AI cloud platforms worldwide to join the DBC network,and the income is used for the destruction of DBC, thus forming a closed business loop.
