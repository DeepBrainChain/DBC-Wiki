# How to apply funds from DBC Treasury

When an applicant applies for funds from the Treasury in a proposal, 5% of the proposal request amount is required to be reserved. If the treasury proposal is approved, the reserved funds will be refunded; if the treasury proposal is rejected, the reserved funds will be slashed. Please note that users cannot withdraw a proposal after it has been submitted.

## 2. off-chain discussion

Before submitting a proposal on-chain, the proposer can discuss the proposal with the council and community members on any occasion off the chain, such as WeChat, telegram community, etc., and integrate the opinions of multiple parties to continuously improve the proposal.

Currently, DBC has established a subreddit community DBC_Council (https://www.reddit.com/r/DBC_Council/ ) on Reddit. The community has also established a proposal discussion flair [proposal_draft discussion]. Proposers can also publish the draft to the community and add flair【proposal_draft discussion】for discussion.

## 3. on-chain submission

submit your proposal on https://www.dbcwallet.io/#/treasury.
Enter the total amount of DBC applied for, and then the system will automatically mortgage 5% of DBC as a security deposit. The maximum of this and the minimum bond will be used to secure the proposal, refundable if it passes.

::: warning
⚠️ Be aware that once submitted the proposal will be put to a council vote. If the proposal is rejected due to a lack of info, invalid requirements or non-benefit to the network as a whole, the full bond posted will be lost.
Please pay attention to the preparation of the proposal and submit a complete and feasible proposal.

Meanwhile，post the final version of your proposal to the DBC subreddit flair【proposal_submitted onchain】(or edit the flair of the draft), with the on-chain proposal number and block height.
