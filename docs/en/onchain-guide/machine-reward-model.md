# Machine reward model

Several factors affecting DBC rewards for computing workers:

- The computing power value of the server device

- Number of GPUs owned

- The number of GPUs owned by a single wallet. For each additional GPU in a single wallet, the points of all machines will increase by 0.01%, up to a maximum of 10%

- Whether the GPU is rented. The hashrate value of rented GPU increased by 30%

- Daily rewards for computing workers = the percentage of computing power owned by computing workers to the total network computing power \*1,095,890 DBC, of which 25% will be released immediately, 75% will be released in the subsequent 150 antennas, and 0.5% will be released every day
