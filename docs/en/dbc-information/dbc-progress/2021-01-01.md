Dear DeepBrain Chain community members,

Thank you for standing with us throughout 2020, let’s take a look at the steps we’ve made forward in the last year and look forward to 2021.

I. Product Development Progress

1. GPU docker and CPU docker functionality went live;

2. Restart of ‘’sleeping docker’’ (docker that ceased to operate) function added, you can now restart these dockers and use them as GPU docker or CPU docker. If you have more than 20k DBC in your wallet balance once your docker cease to operate it will be reserved for a maximum of 7 days, you can restart your docker anytime within the 7 days. If your wallet balance is less than 20k DBC once your docker cease to operate all data will be destroyed;

3. Added the Switching Between CPU Docker and GPU Docker function, user can switch to CPU docker staking mode when they are not using GPU docker, so that they don’t have to pay fee(s);

4. Launched not-in-use docker clearing and not-in-use mirror image clearing function;

5. Auto restart of DBC under anomaly function launched;

II. Marketing Progress

The new coronavirus that devastated the world in 2020 changed everything, but it also accelerated the digital transformation and upgrading of traditional industries. It sped up the arrival of the 5G+AIOT era, now more industries need a massive amount of high-performance compute power, and the distributed high-performance compute power network lead by GPU will become an important infrastructure, which will bring huge development opportunities to DeepBrain Chain.

In 2020, we withstood various challenges and made great progress in the expansion of DBC application scenario, commercialization, solving historical problems of AIMs and expanding the scale of the computing network, laying a solid foundation for the official launch of the main network in 2021.

1. AI Developer Users Continue To Grow Rapidly

AI developer users increased from 2,500 at the beginning of the year to nearly 17,000 by the end of the year. The users come from Beijing University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Nankai University, Wuhan University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Southeast University, Central South University, Dalian University of Technology, Zhongshan University, Renmin University of China, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing University, Sichuan University, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Harvard University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, University of Sydney, Chinese University of Hong Kong, University of Melbourne and other universities with AI-related majors; currently the DeepBrain Chain computing network has become one of the most commonly used GPU cloud service platforms for AI developers in China. Especially when the epidemic first broke out in China, many students faced graduation and needed to prepare their thesis but were unable to return to school to use the servers in the school server room because of the epidemic. The traditional cloud computing vendors were very expensive and the students could not afford them, so the large number of cost-effective GPU servers provided by DeepBrain Chain helped them solve their urgent needs and won the praise of many AI developer users. In addition, we have given free sponsorship of GPU computing power to some university research organizations engaged in the research and development of new coronavirus drugs (such as the Research Center for Drug Discovery (RCDD) of Sun Yat-Sen University

) to support the research and development of new coronavirus drugs;

2. Finding More Industry Customers

In the past year, excluding the period of the COVID-19 outbreak, our colleagues were traveling around China to expand our customer scoop more than 70% of the time, and it was the norm for our technical staff to be working until 1–2AM every night. With everyone’s effort, DeepBrain Chain’s compute power network have made great progress in acquiring enterprise customers, covering blockchain, fintech, biopharmaceutical, remote sensing image, cloud gaming, autopilot, AI education and training, rendering and many other scenarios, and gained the recognition of customers, proving that DeepBrain Chain’s compute network has been able to initially meet the needs of commercial customers and take solid steps in the commercialization of the product;

3. AIMs Released

Thanks to everyone’s patience and support, finally in October 2020 we delivered all the DBC AI Mining machines and is now hosting them in the designated IDC server room. Meanwhile, we have helped the miners to find good customers, and these customers pay to the miners in advance on a monthly basis;

4. DeepBrain Chain’s Compute Network is Growing Rapidly

In the past year, the number of GPUs in DeepBrain Chain compute network increased from less than 100 cards in January to more than 2,000 cards in December, maintaining a stable growth trend overall, and the utilization rate is over 90%;
