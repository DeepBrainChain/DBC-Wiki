Dear DeepBrain Chain community members,

This is the 5th year of DeepBrain Chain, since the establishment of the project, we have been through it all. We have seen the project rise and fall, and some have thought we’ve met our end.

But here we stand, in 2022, in a world of unknown, what we know is that our faith in our vision remains unchanged and unshaken. We thank you for believing in us and let us look forward to great things in the new year.

::: tip
「From 2017 to 2021, DBC has gone through four years, not without twists and turns, but with determination, especially in 2021, great achievements have been made: supernodes have been successfully launched and are running stably, from 21 nodes at the beginning to 41 nodes; the mainchain has been successfully launched and is running stably; the Council has been successfully launched, marking a new stage of community autonomy; the GPU computing power mainnet has been launched, and now the network has nearly 1,000 GPUs, and the occupancy rate is over 96%, and the token destruction mechanism will be activated automatically when the network has more than 5,000 GPUs; the DBC ecosystem has 14 computing pools and dozens of AI cloud platforms, serving nearly 20,000 AI developers and hundreds of enterprises, including AI, metaverse, visual rendering, blockchain and many other industries. DBC is committed to the vision of building the world’s largest distributed high-performance computing network and becoming the computing infrastructure in the era of AI+metaverse.」— Lee, DBC Co-founder

::: tip
Feng, the founder of DeepBrain Chain, predicts the following ten applications that may be born in the future of DeepBrain Chain network, each of these applications is a huge entrepreneurial opportunity, we expect the developers of DeepBrain Chain platform to create the miracle of GPU cloud service applications.
:::

- jupyter cloud: jupyter is deployed on top of the DeepBrain Chain as a cloud service for AI developers

- omniverse cloud: omniverse is deployed on top of DeepBrain Chain and provided to designers and artists in the form of cloud services

- Cloud game Paas service: traditional games are cloudified by calling API interface

- Meta-universe paas service:

  - Meta-universe world realistic scenes need edge cloud GPU servers for rendering calculations, and the calculated images are transmitted to the VR headset end for display in real time, thus avoiding the helmet to perform a lot of calculations and reducing the cost and volume of the helmet.

  - VR live streaming will also begin to rise as an important application of the meta-universe, the technical architecture of VR will be completely different from the live stream from mobiles. The anchor side requires multiple cameras to shoot 360 degrees without dead ends, and the shot is transmitted to the edge cloud GPU server for rendering calculations to form a three-dimensional world effect, and then the results of this calculation are transmitted to the VR headset side.

    ::: tip
    「The real realization of the metaverse will require a huge number of edge GPU cloud servers, which will be spread over hundreds of thousands of edge rooms around the world, with tens of millions of servers.」— Feng, founder of DeepBrain Chain
    :::

- Cloud Rendering Paas Service: Real-time movie rendering through API interface

- Distributed AI training Paas service: Distributed training of geographically distributed nodes through parameter compression and small data learning, etc.

- Grid computing service: suitable for a large task split into multiple small tasks for parallel computing scenarios

- AI inference container scheduling service: by deploying containers in the DeepBrain Chain virtual machine, distributed scheduling of containers is carried out

- Biomolecule analysis SaaS service: DNA, protein and RNA analysis platform with GPU computing as the core

- Physical simulation service: the simulation service implemented on traditional CPU supercomputing can be migrated to GPU
