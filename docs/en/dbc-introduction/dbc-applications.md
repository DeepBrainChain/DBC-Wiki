## Distribution for DBC Token

![DBC token distribution plan ](./assets/dbc-applications.assets/dbc_token.png)

1. The Council is the community-based autonomous center of the future DBC ecosystem

2. The council will unlock at least 51 million DBC per year

3. Unlock 4.25 million DBC to the treasury in the middle of every month, starting from 2022 for 15 consecutive years

4. The council is elected every 2 months

5. Useage of DBC funds pool: infrastructure deployment and continuous operation; network security operations (monitoring services, continuous auditing), ecological support (cooperation with friendly chains), market activities (advertising, payment, cooperation), community activities and Outreach (meetup, pizza parties, hackerspaces), software development (wallet and wallet integration, client and client upgrades), etc.

## DBC Foundation

Founded in 2017, the dbc foundation is mainly responsible for dbc technology development and global ecological construction. The dbc foundation has an annual budget of 49 million dbc.
