# Support for cloud platform

In order to help cloud platform operators get started quickly, solving core operational problems such as funding and customer acquisition, DBC team summarizes this solution based on the operating experience of previous cloud platforms.

## How to get funds？

### Treasury—— the pot of funds

As a decentralized project, DBC implements on-chain governance and has a fund pot dedicated to ecology development - Treasury. Starting from 2022, DBC Foundation will unlock 4.25 million DBC every month, and transfer these funds to the Treasury by a smart contract. Treasury is managed by the council (voted by the community). Funds are mainly used for: infrastructure deployment and ongoing operations; cyber security operations (monitoring services, ongoing audits), ecosystem support (cooperation with friendly chains), marketing activities (advertising, payments, cooperation), community events, and outreach activities (meetups, pizza parties, hackerspaces), software development, etc. Therefore, if the cloud platform needs financial support, it can apply to the Council for Treasury funds through a proposal.

## Find users

(The users here are mainly personal users such as AI developers; if you need business users, we have another team to support them)

### How to find potential users？

The advantage of DBC computing power network is [high cost-effective GPU computing power]. At present, GPU computing power resources are mainly used in various scenarios such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, cloud games, visual rendering, biopharmaceuticals, and semiconductor simulation. Therefore, the places where practitioners in these fields and related majors gather is our target user gathering place, such as the AI developer community, modeling designer forum, design software user community, etc.

Here we also list some target user gathering places.
