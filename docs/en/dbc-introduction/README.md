# Introduction of DBC

DeepBrainChain was established in 2017 and launched on huobi in January 2018. DeepBrainChain is distributed computing with GPU as the core, and mainly provides GPU computing services for artificial intelligence, cloud games, movie rendering and other fields.

At present, we has served hundreds of artificial intelligence and cloud game related companies and more than 20,000 AI practitioners.

The vision of DBC is to build an infinitely scalable distributed high-performance computing network based on blockchain technology, and become the most important computing infrastructure in the AI+ Metaverse era. DeepBrainChain consists of three important parts: high-performance computing network, blockchain main-network, and GPU computing main-network. After 4 years of research and development, the high-performance computing network was officially launched at the end of 2018, and the blockchain main-network was launched in May 20, 2021. And the GPU computing power mainnet was officially launched on November 22. The main-network of DeepBrainChain is developed based on Polkadot Substrate. DeepBrainChain is also one of the few non-financial projects in the blockchain industry that has achieved large-scale implementation.
