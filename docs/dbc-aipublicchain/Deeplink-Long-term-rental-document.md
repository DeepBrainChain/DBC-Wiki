# Deeplink long-term operation process

## 1. List equipment that meets Deeplink mining requirements on the DBC chain

### 1.1 Equipment requirements

+ Reference: https://orion.deeplink.cloud/longterm

### 1.2 Install Deeplink software

+ Software download address: https://www.deeplink.cloud/software

+ If you are using a local disk device, just download and install Deeplink and log in to your wallet

+ If you are using a diskless system to drive a GPU device, please pay attention to the following operations:

+  Install Deeplink in super mode
+ Open the configuration file (%appdata%\deeplink\config.ini)
+ Delete the "uuid" \ "machine_id" in the "[host]" option, keep the token, and delete all the contents of the "[device]" option (the token must be kept, otherwise the GPU device under this diskless server cannot be associated with your wallet)
