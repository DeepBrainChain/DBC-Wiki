If the machine fails to actively send on-chain notifications, the penalty will be more serious. Once the machine is officially on the chain successfully, you cannot modify any hardware configuration information in the future. When the machine is idle and offline at the same time, the bandwidth and latitude and longitude information can be modified. When the machine receives a penalty, only the pledged coins are deducted. The historical rewards that will be issued in the next 150 days will not be deducted, but there is no new online reward.
