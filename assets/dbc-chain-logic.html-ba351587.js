├── dbc-staking 	# Used for node POA block verification rewards, modified from the substrate staking module
├── generic-func 	# Some helper functions, such as serialization/some common calculations
├── dbc-price-ocw 	# offchain-worker，Used to get the real-time price of dbc
|
├── committee 		# Committee module for the management of subsequent machines on the chain
├── online-profile 	# Machine management module, mainly used for machine online/offline/online reward distribution
|
├── maintain-committee 	# After the machine is online, the report module that has problems, the renter can report through this module, and the committee will review it
├── online-committee 	# The machine online review module, which is mainly used for dispatching to the committee for review when the machine is online
├── rent-machine 		# Rent machine/relet
|
└── simple-rpc # Only used to provide RPC, in order to make the testcase simpler, put part of the RPC separately under the palelt
