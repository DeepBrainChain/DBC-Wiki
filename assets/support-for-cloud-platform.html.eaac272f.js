Starting from 2022, DBC Foundation will unlock 4.25 million DBC every month, and transfer these funds to the Treasury by a smart contract. Treasury is managed by the council (voted by the community). Funds are mainly used for: infrastructure deployment and ongoing operations; cyber security operations (monitoring services, ongoing audits), ecosystem support (cooperation with friendly chains), marketing activities (advertising, payments, cooperation), community events, and outreach activities (meetups, pizza parties, hackerspaces), software development, etc. Therefore, if the cloud platform needs financial support, it can apply to the Council for Treasury funds through a proposal.</p><h3 id="application-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#application-process" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Application process</h3><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>Guide | How to apply funds from DBC Treasury \uFF1Ahttps://deepbrainchain.github.io/DBC-Wiki/en/dbc-democracy/apply-treasury.html DeepBrain Chain Proposal - Template https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cqjBCHtvqhdx-0kymg66T7zlW_dkhAM1JVx5RUUuCII/edit?usp=sharing DBC Council sub-Reddit\uFF1Ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/DBC_Council/</p><h2 id="find-users" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#find-users" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Find users</h2><p>(The users here are mainly personal users such as AI developers; if you need business users, we have another team to support them)</p><h3 id="how-to-find-potential-users" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-find-potential-users" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How to find potential users\uFF1F</h3><p>The advantage of DBC computing power network is [high cost-effective GPU computing power].
