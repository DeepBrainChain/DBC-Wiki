Marketing Progress</p><p>The new coronavirus that devastated the world in 2020 changed everything, but it also accelerated the digital transformation and upgrading of traditional industries. It sped up the arrival of the 5G+AIOT era, now more industries need a massive amount of high-performance compute power, and the distributed high-performance compute power network lead by GPU will become an important infrastructure, which will bring huge development opportunities to DeepBrain Chain.</p><p>In 2020, we withstood various challenges and made great progress in the expansion of DBC application scenario, commercialization, solving historical problems of AIMs and expanding the scale of the computing network, laying a solid foundation for the official launch of the main network in 2021.</p><ol><li>AI Developer Users Continue To Grow Rapidly</li></ol><p>AI developer users increased from 2,500 at the beginning of the year to nearly 17,000 by the end of the year. The users come from Beijing University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Nankai University, Wuhan University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Southeast University, Central South University, Dalian University of Technology, Zhongshan University, Renmin University of China, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing University, Sichuan University, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Harvard University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, University of Sydney, Chinese University of Hong Kong, University of Melbourne and other universities with AI-related majors; currently the DeepBrain Chain computing network has become one of the most commonly used GPU cloud service platforms for AI developers in China. Especially when the epidemic first broke out in China, many students faced graduation and needed to prepare their thesis but were unable to return to school to use the servers in the school server room because of the epidemic. The traditional cloud computing vendors were very expensive and the students could not afford them, so the large number of cost-effective GPU servers provided by DeepBrain Chain helped them solve their urgent needs and won the praise of many AI developer users. In addition, we have given free sponsorship of GPU computing power to some university research organizations engaged in the research and development of new coronavirus drugs (such as the Research Center for Drug Discovery (RCDD) of Sun Yat-Sen University</p><p>) to support the research and development of new coronavirus drugs;</p><ol start="2"><li>Finding More Industry Customers</li></ol><p>In the past year, excluding the period of the COVID-19 outbreak, our colleagues were traveling around China to expand our customer scoop more than 70% of the time, and it was the norm for our technical staff to be working until 1–2AM every night.
