Will DeepBrain Chain develop business in these areas afterwards?</p><p>A：You may not be aware that the distributed high-performance computing network built by DeepBrain Chain is one of the key supporting technologies of the meta-universe. Among the six supporting technologies of metaverse (blockchain technology, Internet of Things technology, interaction technology, video game technology, artificial intelligence technology, network and computing technology), four of them are closely related to DeepBrain Chain, and the cloud game, which is the key service area of DeepBrain Chain, is the necessary path to the metaverse era.

Also tell us use cases of token in whole ecosystem of deepbrainChain? A：DBC has 10 billion DBC tokens in total, 40% of which will be distributed as online rewards to the computing power providers, 10% will be rewarded to the early computing power providers that provided computing power on DBC network before the mainnet went online, that is to say, 50% of the tokens are allocated to computing power providers. The team has 1 billion DBCs, which will be unlocked in ten years on average, and the Foundation and Council has a total of 2.5 billion, which will be unlocked in nineteen years, so the reason for doing this is to have enough patience for DBC. At present the total circulation of DBC is more than 4 billion. DBC computing power provider&#39;s rewards consist of two parts: supernodes block producing rewards and computing power provider online rewards, the first three years are 100 million and 400 million DBC respectively, from the third year on the amount is halved, after that the amount is halved again every five years. Supernode pledge: currently there are 31 supernodes, tentatively 10 nodes will be added each quarter. Each node first need to pledges DBC tokens to participate in the supernode election; Any DBC holder can pledge DBC to vote for the node, and rewards are also given to voters; The top 31 nodes voters can become supernodes, the election is held every 24 hours. GPU power provider pledge rules: From 0 to 10,000 GPUs, 100,000 DBCs are pledged per GPU. Starting from 10,001 GPU, the formula for the total number of DBC that needs to be pledged is: 1 billion + 100,000 x (10000/10001 + 10000/10002 + ∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙ + 10000/(10000+n)). If the above formula is accounted for and a single GPU is pledged at 1,500 USD 50,000 RMB, then the pledge is calculated at 1500 USD 50,000 RMB.</p><p>Example of the number of single GPU pledges:</p><p>Assuming that n0000 shows the first 1000 GPUs after 10,000, then the number of pledges for the 11000th GPU is: 100,000 x 10000/11000.</p><p>DBCs pledged by each graphics card need to be pledged for at least 365 days; when the machine is online for more than 365 days and no user uses it for more than 10 days, you can exit the pledged, take the machine offline and release the pledged DBC within 3 days, and the previously obtained rewards will continue to be released linearly.</p><p>There is also the deflationary model, which is the DBC burning rule.</p><p>When the DBC network reaches 5,000 GPUs across the network, 100% of the rents paid by users after activation are destroyed, which means DBC will enter a deflationary state. So reaching 5,000 GPUs in the DBC network will be an important milestone!</p><p>DBC is the only payment credentials in the entire DBC arithmetic network, and enterprises need to use DBC to provide arithmetic to the DBC network or rent arithmetic, including pledging.</p><p>Q：What are your aims in next 2 years according to your roadmap? What if I ask you what is the ultimate goal of DeepBrainchain?</p><p>A：On the supply side, the goal of DeepBrain Chain ecosystem in the next 2 years is to add 100 computing pools worldwide to join the DBC network, providing a continuous source of computing power for the computing network; at the same time, on the demand side, the goal of DeepBrain Chain ecosystem in the next 2 years is to add 50-100 AI cloud platforms globally, the value of these cloud platforms is so that the network can sell the computing power to them, and the income is used for the destruction of DBC, thus forming a closed business loop.</p><p>DeepBrain Chain’s vision is to build an infinitely scalable high-performance distributed computing power network, and become the most important computing infrastructure in the AI+MetaVerse era.</p><p>Q：What is the overall design of DBC’s community governance mechanism? What is the process of initiation if new institutions are to be added in the future (such as the Council to be established in the near future)?</p><p>A：DeepBrain Chain community autonomy mainly relies on DeepBrain Chain Council, DeepBrain Chain Council has 51 million DBC per year for 15 years; all Council members are elected by the community and are responsible for managing the distribution of Council funds, all community members can propose to apply for funds and contribute to the ecosystem, Foundation members do not participate in the election and operation of the Council.

DeepBrain Chain will conduct strict code audit every time it is upgraded, and find professional organizations in the industry to do security audit, and at the same time, it will run for a trial period before upgrading 2. DeepBrain Chain itself is a high performance computing network, the network has thousands of nodes, each node is a high performance server, currently there are 31 supernodes responsible for the producing blocks, and at the same time, 10 nodes will be added every quarter, so it is very difficult and incredibly costly to attack DeepBrain Chain network.</p><p>Q：Do you think you can connect real-life and CryptoWorld with you project?How do you think the utility of you projects?</p>",15),R={href:"https://galaxyrace.deepbrainchain.org",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},V=e("p",null,"For example, the NetEase cloud gaming platform is using the GPU of the DBC platform",-1),J=e("p",null,"Q：What is your inspiration behind this project and how are u planning to expand your ecosystem and attracting more investors so that you can stay in the business for a long time?",-1),L=e("p",null,"A：We have been focusing on AI projects since 2011, including voice assistants, smart speakers and other products.

The Artificial intelligence race is the computing power race: solving the problem of computing power supply and demand and rewarding computing power is imminent.
