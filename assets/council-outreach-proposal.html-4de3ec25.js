DBC has been committed to establishing a complete on-chain governance and community governance mechanism, attracting a large number of outstanding talents who agree with the DBC vision to join the DBC community and contribute to the ecological development of the community. At present, DBC has realized the DAO through the council system - the council is elected by community members and participates in project governance on behalf of their interests. Among them, the management of treasury funds is one of the main ways of governance of the council. According to the planning of the council system, the DBC fund pool is used for infrastructure deployment and continued operation, network security operations (monitoring services, continuous auditing), ecosystem provisions (collaborations with friendly chains), marketing activities (advertising, paid features, collaborations), community events and outreach (meetups, pizza parties, hackerspaces), software development (wallets and wallet integration, clients and client upgrades) and more.",-1),m=e("p",null,"In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the community and give full play to the power of the council and the community, we hope to establish a marketing mechanism led by the DBC council and the community, further optimize community governance and the efficiency of the use of treasury funds, and enhance the influence of DBC on a global scale.

Under the marketing mechanism led by the council and the community, active members of the council and the community can participate in all aspects of KOL cooperation, actively explore high-quality cooperation opportunities, and assist KOL to complete the cooperation. As a reward, the cooperation leader can apply for a certain amount of DBC from the national treasury as a service fee. In order to mobilize everyone's enthusiasm in the early stage, we suggest that it be 20%-30% of the cooperation funds (approved by the DBC council), especially excellent cooperation cases It can reach 50%. For example, the transaction price of a youtube cooperation is 4000U, and the cooperation leader can get 800U, so the treasury approval fee is 4800U, and so on.
