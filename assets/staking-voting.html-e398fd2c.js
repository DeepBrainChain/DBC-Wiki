If you click in and find that the return is not shown, you can click return and it will be automatically sorted from largest to smallest.</p><p>Total equity: refers to the total number of DBC of the node itself plus the total amount of DBC of the nominee who pledged on said node, the top 41 are elected, and whether you can be elected as a supernode only depends on this data.</p><p>Commission: The DBC network will send equal amount of DBC to these supernodes every day, but the supernodes need servers to help the network to verify the blocks, all supernodes can set their own commission percentage themselves, the higher the commission percentage, the more the supernode can get, then the user who pledges on said supernode will get less, because the total number is set.</p><p>In order for you to understand the pledge model in layman&#39;s terms, here is an easy-to-understand example:</p><p>DBC mainnet will prepare 41 pieces of cake for users every day, but how to share these cakes to ensure it&#39;s fair and convincing? DBC will set countless group leader quotas, that is, supernodes, but the cake is only 41 pieces, all these group leaders are running in the election, how can you guarantee that you will be elected? It all comes down to the total number of votes in your hands, that is, the number of DBC this supernode can pledge by themself and the number of DBCs pledged on said node by others, as long as the total amount ranks in the top 41. What needs to be done is for these supernodes to go to the major communities to pull votes or hold a large amount of DBC to ensure the number of votes, in order to guarantee that in the next round they can be ranked in the first 41 to get this piece of cake.</p><p>There is another problem, the cake is there, but how to share the cake? I gave this supernode vote(s) now how do I calculate the specific benefits I will get?</p><p>First of all, the DBC mainnet will give this piece of cake to the supernode, that is, every day the supernode will get 6,772 (calculated according to 41 nodes) or so DBC, now the data on the target page can help us to filter the supernodes better.</p><figure><img src="'+v+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="'+B+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The formula for calculating the earned cake (DBC) = (total amount of cake _ (1 - commission) _ (the percentage of your own DBC in the total equity of the node))</p><p>Tips: Supernodes earn their income in two ways, the first is the commission percentage you set * the weight of the cake (DBC) earned +</p><p>Total cake _ (1 - commission) _ (the proportion of the supernode&#39;s DBC to the node&#39;s total equity))</p><p>To explain the formula, the first thing to look at is the number below the commission, the percentage is set up by the supernode itself. For example, if you set it up as 0%, that means once the supernode itself got the cake, it will not get itself any extra DBC rewards, it will share with the ones that pledged on it, and then according to their DBC holdings positions, the higher the position the more you get.</p><p>But truthfully no nodes will set their ratio at 0%. The bigger the ratio is set, the more the supernode will get as extra and then share the rest with its pledgers. If the ratio is set to 100%, that means the supernode will not give a bite of the cake to the pledger, you can ignore such node(s), because by pledging on such node(s) you will not get any revenue.</p></div><p>But it&#39;s not that the lower the ratio the better, otherwise there will not be so many other screening conditions.</p><figure><img src="'+C+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>So the cause and effect is that the total amount of equity in this node accounted for by this commission and your position determines your earnings, which is the size of the RETURN.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>Note: When you are pledging in accordance with the RETURN ranking after choosing the first 21 in the relatively high RETURN ratio, and then look for some reliable nodes, why should you choose a reliable node? The reason is that some nodes you see might have set their commission ratio very low, or even set to 0, so that their return will naturally be higher, to attract pledgers to vote, but when such node is elected as a supernode, they are able to change their commission ratio, that is, to improve the DBC earnings they get, so others get a lot less naturally. So we need to find some reliable nodes, so that although we get a smaller income compared to choosing another node, this may ensure that our income is very stable. This requires us to join some official voting community to really get in touch with such supernodes candidates to ensure that the supernodes we vote for are reliable.</p></div><p>Another factor that needs to be considered is the condition of the supernode&#39;s machine.</p><figure><img src="'+x+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="'+D+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>After clicking on these curve icons we can see some penalties and rewards.
