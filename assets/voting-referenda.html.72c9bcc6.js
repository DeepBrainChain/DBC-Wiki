Voting</h2><p>At the end of each launch period, the most seconded proposal will move to a referendum. During this time you can cast a vote for or against the proposal. You may also lock up your tokens for a greater length of time to weigh your vote more strongly. During the time your tokens are locked, you are unable to transfer them, however, they can still be used for further votes. If you don\u2019t want to lock your tokens, you still can participate in voting.</p><p>Click \u201Cvote\u201D and see this page.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>If you would like to cast your vote for the proposal select the \u201CVote Aye\u201D option.
