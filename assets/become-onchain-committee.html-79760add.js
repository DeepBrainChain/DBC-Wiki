Responsibilities of the committee</h2><p>In order to maintain the DBC network, we have set up a &quot;committee&quot; role. The committee has two main responsibilities:</p><ol><li><p>Perform the task of machine verification when the machine is online. When a new machine wants to join the DBC network, three committees in normal state will be randomly selected. The selected committee can verify the machine configuration and submit it to the chain at a designated time.</p></li><li><p>Deal with the report of the renter during the renting period. When the renter encounters a machine fault, the problem will be reported to the chain. If the committee handles the report and the report is confirmed by other committee, the machine will be punished and a fine will be issued to the committee dealing with the problem.</p></li></ol><h2 id="_2-become-a-member-of-the-verification-committee" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-become-a-member-of-the-verification-committee" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.
