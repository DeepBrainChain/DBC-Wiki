DeepBrain Chain contains three important parts: high-performance computing network, blockchain mainnet and GPU computing mainnet.

The current popular technology fields such as autonomous driving, robotics, high-end Internet of Things, etc. are interspersed with AI technology, which means that DeepBrain Chain will further drive the development of the whole technology field by empowering the AI segment. At present, the computing power required for AI doubles every 2 months, and the supply level of the new computing power infrastructure carrying AI will directly affect the AI innovation iteration and industrial AI application landing.
