At present, DBC has realized the DAO through the council system - the council is elected by community members and participates in project governance on behalf of their interests. Among them, the management of treasury funds is one of the main ways of governance of the council. According to the planning of the council system, the DBC fund pool is used for infrastructure deployment and continued operation, network security operations (monitoring services, continuous auditing), ecosystem provisions (collaborations with friendly chains), marketing activities (advertising, paid features, collaborations), community events and outreach (meetups, pizza parties, hackerspaces), software development (wallets and wallet integration, clients and client upgrades) and more.",-1)),e[5]||(e[5]=o("p",null,"In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the community and give full play to the power of the council and the community, we hope to establish a marketing mechanism led by the DBC council and the community, further optimize community governance and the efficiency of the use of treasury funds, and enhance the influence of DBC on a global scale.
