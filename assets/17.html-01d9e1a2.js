We want people here and in the greater states of North America to understand what it is for their company to rent Deep Brain Chains Computing Power and add to the ever growing Ai Mainnet.</p><p>My Team are as follows -</p><p>Brian - IT Engineer</p><p>Maksim - Coding and Quality Engineer</p><p>Eugene - Server and GPU Engineer</p><p>Severs DATA Center staff to ensure the continuous running of the Servers we will provide</p><p>Problem statement</p><p>The main goal for the request of support is to provide a number of servers/GPUs within the North America Region Located in the Tampa Region in Florida, soon to be the &#39;Hub of Ai Computing&#39; in America. I have a Tier 3 and higher Data Server chosen and am in the process of building the first Server for this location. I would like to obtain further help/funding to provide the DBC network an additional Server/GPUs. Once the server is up and running I will reinvest earned DBC from the rewards back into buying several Servers/GPUs, thus providing further and much needed support for the North America Location. My goal is to have 1 server a month installed with a total of 12 by the end of 2022 with a total of 24 GPUs. With the support of the DBC Council we could double or triple this number, we have the team to do so.</p><p>I appreciate your time and hope to become the DBC representative for the Northern American region.
