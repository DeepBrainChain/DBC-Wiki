There are presumably over 900 million coins that were not swapped. The community is not interested in performing another swap and the swap went on for over a year (from the first announcements to the second chance swap).</p><p>There are a lot of strong feelings about what to do with the coins. This proposal is intended to be a compromise everyone can agree on. The goal is to do what is in the best interest of the entire community and not cause an unnecessary burden on the DBC Foundation, the council, or the community.</p><p>Each element of this proposal may be fine-tuned in future proposals that detail the rules of that particular element, but this proposal will determine the high-level decisions and guidelines we will follow. Any future proposals referring to the funds in this proposal must adhere to the rules of this proposal less the changes be specifically called out and voted on.</p><p>The unswapped coins will be split and distributed as follows.</p><p>120,000,000 coins for additional treasury funding.</p><p>These 120 million coins will be held by the DBC Foundation and distributed into the treasury once per month. 5,000,000 coins will be added to the treasury from this fund for 2 years (24 months) until the fund is depleted. These funds are in addition to the funds the DBC Foundation already injects into the treasury and the treasury earnings that come from fees and other sources.</p><p>The intention of these additional treasury funds is to aid the ecological development including cloud platforms, GPU pools, marketing, blockchain tools, and more. However, each term the council will decide what proposals, tips, and bounties are deserving of the funds.</p><p>120,000,000 coins for exchange listing support.</p><p>These 120 million coins will be held by the DBC Foundation and released at the DBC Foundation&#39;s discretion for the sole purpose of listing DBC on new exchanges and participating in trading features or contests on exchanges. These funds cannot be used for anything other than assisting exchange listings and participation. The council should work with the DBC Foundation to find new exchanges and get listed.</p><p>After two years from the passing of this proposal, any remaining coins that have not been used for new exchange listing will be immediately destroyed.</p><p>133,000,000 coins to the galaxy contest.</p><p>Currently, once the galaxy contest starts, rent will be burned and 133,000,000 DBC will be shared by all computing workers. With these funds, we intend to work with the team to double the rewards for all computing workers during the contest. This will make the total share rewards among computing workers 266,000,000. That figure does not include the bonus awards for the top five computing workers, as mentioned in the rules https://galaxyrace.deepbrainchain.org/rule_En.</p><p>These funds will only be added to the galaxy contest rewards if the rules remain as designed. The contest will not start until 5000 GPUs are reached. Rental destruction will not start until 5000 GPUs are reached. The council will work with the DBC Foundation to ensure the funds are added to the reward system.</p><p>Around 600,000,000 coins will be destroyed immediately.</p><p>All unswapped coins not included in the sections above will be immediately burned or destroyed so that they may never enter circulation again. Future votes cannot impact these coins. The DBC Foundation will not have access to these coins. A third coin swap can never happen.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>This proposal is based on the opinions of the community. It is intended to best serve all interested parties without favoring any one side. Once passed, CRAZYSIX will work closely with the DBC Foundation to ensure all funds are handled correctly.</p><p>\u8BE5\u63D0\u6848\u65E8\u5728\u4F5C\u4E3A\u672A\u4EA4\u6362\u4EE3\u5E01\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6700\u7EC8\u51B3\u5B9A\u3002 \u5927\u7EA6\u6709 9
